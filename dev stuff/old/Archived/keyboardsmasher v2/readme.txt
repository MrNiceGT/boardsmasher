Notes
	This is the second game that I uploaded to GitHub. I have rewritten the game from scratch, and I cleaned some of the code. 
	Do note that I used some rather 'lazy' choices somewhere but I took my time commenting out almost all the code to explain what they do, and I hope that they are understandable.
	The icon is my logo, which is Holden Caulfield's red hunting hat from The Catcher in The Rye. I'm a goddamn phoney. I really am.

Big Thanks To
	MJGamerTV - for playtesting my game! He's my small cousin, by the way.

TODO:
	(i) In the 'game' section, the symbols "blink" before they disappear. It's not game breaking, just a visual glitch.

Thank you for downloading, and enjoy!!
