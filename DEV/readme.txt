------------------
Update 1.0.1 (13th February, 2021)
- Removed "O" and "0" for the mash event since the two can be confused with each other
- Changed "SMASH!" to "Press keys!" since some players found the former confusing
- Added a "denied" sound effect when the player presses key when the game is not ready yet.
