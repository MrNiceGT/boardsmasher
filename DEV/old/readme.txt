Notes
    This is the second game that I uploaded to GitHub. I have rewritten the game from scratch, and I cleaned some of the code. 
    The icon is my logo, which is Holden Caulfield's red hunting hat from The Catcher in The Rye. I'm a goddamn phoney. I really am.

Big Thanks To

Known bugs:
    (i) In the 'game' section, the symbols "blink" before they disappear. It's not game breaking, but a visual glitch.
